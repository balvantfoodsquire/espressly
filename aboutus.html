                    <p>In the mid-1600's, coffee was brought to New Amsterdam, later called New York by the British. Though coffee houses rapidly began to appear, tea continued to be the favored drink in the New World until 1773, when the colonists revolted against a heavy tax on tea imposed by King George III. The revolt, known as Boston Tea Party, would forever change the American drinking preference to coffee. </p>

                    <p>In 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam presented a gift of a young coffee plant to King Louis XIV of France. The King ordered it to be planted in the Royal Botanical Garden in Paris. In 1723, a young naval officer, Gabriel de Clieu obtained a seedling from the King's plant. Despite a challenging voyage -complete with horrendous weather, a saboteur who tried to destroy the seedling, and a pirate attack -he managed to transport it safely to Martinique. </p>
